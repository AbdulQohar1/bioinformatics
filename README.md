# FASTA File Analysis - Bioinformatics Assignment

This project contains a Jupyter/Colab notebook, **FASTA_analysis.ipynb**, designed for hands-on bioinformatics tasks using FASTA files. The notebook guides users through essential sequence analysis techniques using both Bash and Python.

## Features

- **Data Preparation:** 
Instructions for downloading and extracting sample FASTA files.
  !wget -O bioinformatics_data.zip 'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1KPGqMmiBqSWEhjUFNYxgOqtCkyNwA1aU'

Unzip the data using unzip package
  install unzip package using the command: 
  !apt-get install unzip
  !unzip bioinformatics_data.zip -d /content/bioinformatics_data

- **Sequence Counting:** 
Count the number of sequences in FASTA files using Bash and Python.

- **Sequence Lengths:** 
Calculate the length of each sequence, excluding headers.

- **Longest & Shortest Sequence:** 
Identify the longest and shortest sequences in a FASTA file.

- **DNA to Protein Translation:** 
Translate DNA sequences to protein using a codon table.

- **Comparative Notes:** 
Insights on using Bash vs Python for bioinformatics tasks.

## Usage

1. Open `FASTA_analysis.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions and code cells.
3. Download the provided data and run the analysis.
4. Review comments and markdown explanations for guidance.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
- Basic Bash utilities (for shell commands)

## **Submission Instructions**
1. Create a Jupyter/Colab notebook with your solutions.  
2. Add comments to explain your code.
3. In a markdown cell after the second task, write a short note comparing using bash and python for the same tasks.  
3. Save your notebook as **`FASTA_analysis.ipynb`**  
4. Submit the file via **Google Drive/Email/other instructions**.
